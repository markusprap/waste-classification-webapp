# Learning Journey - Waste Classification Project

## Week 1-2: Research & Planning
- Studied microservices architecture from various online resources
- Watched YouTube tutorials on Next.js and Flask integration
- Read documentation: Hapi.js, TensorFlow.js, Prisma

## Week 3-4: Frontend Development
- Started with basic Next.js setup
- Learned Tailwind CSS from official docs
- Implemented responsive design based on Bootstrap concepts
- Added authentication using NextAuth.js (took 2 days to figure out)

## Week 5-6: Backend Development
- Chose Hapi.js after comparing with Express.js
- Learned about REST API design principles
- Implemented database with Prisma (easier than raw SQL)
- Added proper error handling after testing

## Week 7-8: ML Integration
- Initially tried client-side TensorFlow.js (too slow)
- Switched to Flask API after performance testing
- Learned Python Flask from tutorials
- Model provided by ML team member

## Challenges Faced:
1. **CORS issues** - took half day to resolve
2. **File upload handling** - multiple attempts with different libraries
3. **Database migrations** - learned the hard way
4. **Deployment configuration** - still working on this

- Flask mega-tutorial by Miguel Grinberg
- Stack Overflow for debugging
- GitHub repositories for reference
